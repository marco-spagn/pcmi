## 2. Executive Summary

### Overview

On March 31, 2026, a critical supply chain attack was executed against the Axios npm package — one of the most widely used JavaScript HTTP client libraries in the world, with over **100 million weekly downloads** and deployment in approximately **80% of cloud and code environments**. A threat actor compromised the npm maintainer credentials of the primary Axios maintainer and published two malicious versions: **1.14.1** and **0.30.4**. These versions introduced a single new dependency, `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1`, a typosquat of the legitimate `crypto-js` package, which served as a multi-stage dropper for a cross-platform Remote Access Trojan (RAT).

The exposure window lasted approximately **169 minutes** (from 00:21 to 03:20 UTC on March 31, 2026) before npm intervened and removed the compromised packages. During this window, an undetermined number of developer machines, CI/CD pipelines, and production environments installed the malicious code. Wiz reports that at least **3% of monitored environments** showed execution of the compromised packages.

Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant attributed this attack to **UNC1069**, a financially motivated North Korea-nexus threat actor. The malware deployed is tracked as **WAVESHAPER.V2**, a sophisticated RAT with reconnaissance, command execution, PE injection, and persistent C2 capabilities.

### Attribution & Threat Actor

**UNC1069** (per Google GTIG/Mandiant) is a North Korea-nexus financially motivated threat group. Key attribution indicators include:

- Infrastructure overlap with prior UNC1069 campaigns (domain `sfrclak[.]com`, IP `142.11.206.73`, secondary IP `23.254.167.216`).
- Use of the **WAVESHAPER.V2** backdoor family, a known UNC1069 tool.
- The **SILKBELL** dropper component (setup.js) matches previously observed UNC1069 tooling patterns.
- Attacker-controlled email `ifstap@proton.me` was used to take over the maintainer account.
- A secondary email `nrwise@proton.me` was also observed in connection with the compromised accounts.

**Note:** The Datadog report noted that attribution artifacts in the payloads did not match the recent TeamPCP supply chain campaign, suggesting UNC1069 operates as a separate cluster within the DPRK cyber operations ecosystem.

---

## 3. Technical Details

### 3.1 Malware Analysis

#### Stage 0: Account Compromise

The attack began with the theft of a **classic npm access token** (long-lived, non-2FA-protected) belonging to the primary Axios maintainer (`jasonsaayman`). The attacker changed the account email to `ifstap@proton.me` and gained publishing permissions that exceeded those of other maintainers. The attacker then bypassed the legitimate CI/CD pipeline and published directly from the hijacked account.

#### Stage 1: Malicious Dependency Injection

Two axios versions were published:
- `axios@1.14.1` (targeting latest users)
- `axios@0.30.4` (targeting users pinned to the 0.x branch)

Both versions were identical to their legitimate predecessors except for one change: the addition of `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1` as a dependency. This package had been staged with a clean version (4.2.0) minutes before the attack to avoid suspicion.

#### Stage 2: Obfuscated Dropper (`setup.js`)

The `plain-crypto-js` package contained an obfuscated JavaScript file (`setup.js`, ~4 KB) triggered via npm's `postinstall` hook. The dropper employed:

- **Two-layer encoding**: Reversed Base64 + custom XOR cipher (key: `OrDeR_7077`)
- **OS detection**: Branched execution to Windows, macOS, or Linux-specific routines
- **Anti-forensics**: Self-deleted `setup.js` and restored original `package.json` after payload delivery
- **Speed**: All dropper operations completed in under 2 seconds, before npm finished installing other dependencies
- **Campaign identifier**: `6202033` embedded throughout the tooling

#### Stage 3: Platform-Specific RAT Payloads (WAVESHAPER.V2)

**macOS:**
- Downloaded a universal Mach-O binary RAT to `/Library/Caches/com.apple.act.mond`
- Delivered via AppleScript, executed through `zsh`
- Ad-hoc codesigned to bypass Gatekeeper
- Masqueraded as a legitimate Apple process
- Most complete and functional payload (per Datadog analysis)
- No persistence mechanism implemented

**Windows:**
- Downloaded a PowerShell RAT via VBScript wrapper
- Copied legitimate `powershell.exe` to `%PROGRAMDATA%\wt.exe` to evade EDR
- Persistence via registry Run key (`MicrosoftUpdate` in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) and hidden batch file (`%PROGRAMDATA%\system.bat`)
- Supported reflective .NET PE injection (fileless, in-memory)
- Per Datadog, the Windows script had a bug that prevented proper beaconing initiation

**Linux:**
- Downloaded Python script to `/tmp/ld.py` via curl
- No persistence mechanism
- Per Datadog, the Linux RAT crashed in most containerized environments due to improper user information retrieval
- Linux payload was never fully recovered by researchers (per derp.ca)

#### RAT Capabilities (All Platforms)

All WAVESHAPER.V2 variants shared a common C2 protocol and command set:

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| System Reconnaissance | Hostname, username, boot time, timezone, OS version, process lists |
| Directory Listing | Full file paths, sizes, creation/modification timestamps |
| Command Execution | Arbitrary shell commands |
| PE Injection | In-memory Portable Executable injection (Windows) |
| Script Execution | AppleScript execution (macOS), arbitrary code injection |
| File Download | Ingress tool transfer from C2 |
| Process Termination | Kill command for self-termination |

### 3.2 Infrastructure Analysis

| Component | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| C2 Domain | `sfrclak[.]com` | Registered hours before the attack |
| C2 IP | `142.11.206.73` | Hosted by Hostwinds, Seattle (AS54290) |
| C2 Port | `8000` (HTTP) | Plain HTTP, no TLS |
| C2 URL | `http://sfrclak[.]com:8000/6202033` | Payload delivery and beacon endpoint |
| Secondary IP | `23.254.167.216` | Suspected additional UNC1069 infrastructure |
| Beacon Interval | 60 seconds | Consistent across all platforms |
| User-Agent | `mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 8.0; windows nt 5.1; trident/4.0)` | Static, mimics IE8 on Windows XP |
| C2 Protocol | HTTP POST with Base64-encoded JSON | POST bodies mimic npm registry traffic (`packages.npm.org/product{0,1,2}`) |

The infrastructure was dismantled shortly after npm removed the compromised packages. No prior malicious activity was associated with the C2 infrastructure before this campaign.

### 3.3 Downstream Propagation

Two additional npm packages were found to have vendored or depended on the trojanized Axios, propagating the compromise further into the ecosystem:
- `@shadanai/openclaw`
- `@qqbrowser/openclaw-qbot` (v0.0.130)

These packages either bundled the trojanized dependency directly or pulled in the tampered Axios, demonstrating how a single poisoned package can rapidly contaminate downstream dependencies, especially in automated CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 4. Detection Opportunities

### 4.1 Behavioral Detections (per Elastic Security Labs)

Elastic's behavioral detection strategy proved highly effective. Recommended detection rules focus on:

- **Process ancestry monitoring**: Node.js processes spawning OS-native shells (sh, cscript, osascript) that then fetch and execute remote payloads
- **Network retrieval by interpreters**: PowerShell, Python, curl/wget downloading executables from non-standard ports
- **Background execution detachment**: Child processes detaching from parent node process tree
- **Renamed signed binaries**: Detection of `powershell.exe` copied to non-standard paths (e.g., `wt.exe`)

### 4.2 Network-Based Detections

- Monitor for HTTP POST traffic to port 8000 with IE8/Windows XP User-Agent strings
- Alert on POST body patterns containing `packages.npm.org/product` strings to non-npm infrastructure
- Block/alert on traffic to `sfrclak[.]com` and `142.11.206.73`

### 4.3 Host-Based Detections

- **macOS**: Presence of `/Library/Caches/com.apple.act.mond` (unsigned or ad-hoc signed Mach-O binary)
- **Windows**: Registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\MicrosoftUpdate`, presence of `%PROGRAMDATA%\wt.exe` or `%PROGRAMDATA%\system.bat`
- **Linux**: Presence of `/tmp/ld.py`
- **All platforms**: npm audit for `axios@1.14.1`, `axios@0.30.4`, or `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1`

### 4.4 Sophos Detection Signatures

- `JS/Agent-BLYB` (JavaScript dropper)
- `Troj/PSAgent-CN` (PowerShell RAT)

### 4.5 Package Ecosystem Checks

- Audit for advisory IDs: `GHSA-fw8c-xr5c-95f9`, `MAL-2026-2306`
- Verify axios package publisher metadata (check for unexpected email changes)
- Monitor for npm packages with `postinstall` hooks pulling previously unknown dependencies

## 5. Conclusion

The Axios npm supply chain attack represents one of the most significant software supply chain compromises in recent memory. Key takeaways across all 12 analyzed sources:

1. **Scale of Impact**: With ~100M weekly downloads, the blast radius was enormous, though the 169-minute exposure window limited actual propagation. Wiz estimated 3% of monitored environments executed the compromised code.

2. **Sophistication**: The attack demonstrated advanced tradecraft — multi-layer obfuscation, cross-platform RAT delivery, anti-forensic cleanup, and C2 traffic masquerading as legitimate npm registry activity.

3. **Operational Weaknesses**: Despite the sophisticated initial compromise, the RAT payloads contained bugs: the Windows variant failed to beacon properly, and the Linux variant crashed in containers — suggesting possible rush to deployment or limited testing.

4. **Attribution**: Google GTIG/Mandiant attributed the attack to UNC1069, a North Korea-nexus threat actor, based on infrastructure and tooling overlaps with prior campaigns. Not all sources agreed on attribution; Datadog noted the attack did not match the TeamPCP campaign cluster.

5. **Systemic Risk**: This incident exposes fundamental weaknesses in the npm ecosystem: long-lived access tokens, lack of mandatory 2FA for critical packages, insufficient publishing provenance controls, and the transitive trust model that allows a single compromised dependency to cascade to millions of consumers.

**Recommended Immediate Actions:**
- Audit all environments for `axios@1.14.1`, `axios@0.30.4`, and `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1`
- Rotate all credentials potentially exposed on compromised systems
- Review CI/CD pipeline logs for anomalous npm install activity during the exposure window (March 31, 00:21–03:20 UTC)
- Monitor for C2 indicators and file artifacts listed below
- Pin and lock dependency versions; enable `npm audit` in CI pipelines
